#CALCULATING A DISTANCE MATRIX

#boundaries we have are not in British National Grid - the bit that says proj4string tells me 
#that we are in WGS84 or using latitude and longitude coordinates. We need to change this to 
#British National Grid so our distances are in metres and not decimal degrees, then do everything 
#we need to do to generate a distance matrix.

#first transfrom to BNG - this will be important for calculating distances using spTransform
BNG = "+init=epsg:27700"
LondonBNG <- spTransform(London, BNG)
#now, order by borough code - *this step will be imporant later on*
LondonBNG <- LondonBNG[order(LondonBNG$lad15cd),]
#now use spDists to generate a big distance matrix of all distances between boroughs in London
dist <- spDists(LondonBNG)
#melt this matrix into a list of origin/destination pairs using melt. Melt in in the reshape2 package. Reshape2, dplyr and ggplot, together, are some of the best packages in R, so if you are not familiar with them, get googling and your life will be much better!
distPair <- melt(dist)
